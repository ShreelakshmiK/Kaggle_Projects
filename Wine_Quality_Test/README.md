# Wine Quality Prediction

## Problem Identification

### The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The main aim is to find which ingredients are responsible for the quality of wine. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

### I analyzed a wine data dataset using K nearest neighbour to predict the quality of wine based on the following contents:

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

### Output variable 

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Steps Followed:

###1] Data Analysis

###2] Data Cleaning(Delete duplicates etc..)

###3] Data Munging (Outliers, Null values treated with imputing technique)

###4] Data Visualization

###5] Machine learning (Logistic Regression,K Nearest Neighbors)
